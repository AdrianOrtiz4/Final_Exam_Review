# About

On this repo you will find all that you need for the lab. 
### There is _main.cpp_ with example test cases. There is also a _StarterCode.hpp_ with all the classes. And finally there is a _Exercises_ folder that contains the starter code of all execises that require one.

 \* Notice that the first two exercises you will have to complete them on the _StarterCode.hpp_ in order for everything to work.\*

## How to use and run

Notice that example cases are commented on the main.cpp file.
Every time tha you finish an exercise, go ahead and uncomment the respective examples and run the code to test.

To run examples, first type: _make_ on the terminal and then: _make run_

Also, you can use the Run and Debug option on the VS Code left menu.
